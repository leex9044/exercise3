<h2>A Place I Would Like to Visit</h2>
<p>If I <br> could visit any place in the world, I would visit Australia.
    I've been wanting to travel to Australia since High School and have always dreamed of visiting the Australia Zoo.
    Growing up, I watched a lot Animal Planet and have always wanted to go to the home of the Crocodile Hunter, Steve
    Erwin.

<h2>A Person I Admire</h2>
<p>The person I admire the most is my dad. He went through a lot during his childhood
    and made many sacrifices for our family. It's taken awhile for us to see eye to eye,
    but he's taught me to work hard and play hard.
